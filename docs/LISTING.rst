Listing
=======

Listing Types
-------------

We use three different types of metadata listing for various operations.
Here are the scenarios we use each for:

-  'Delimiter' - when no versions are possible in the bucket since it is
   an internally-used only bucket which is not exposed to a user.
   Namely,

1. to list objects in the "user's bucket" to respond to a GET SERVICE
   request and
2. to do internal listings on an MPU shadow bucket to complete multipart
   upload operations.

-  'DelimiterVersion' - to list all versions in a bucket
-  'DelimiterMaster' - to list just the master versions of objects in a
   bucket

Algorithms
----------

The algorithms for each listing type can be found in the open-source
`scality/Arsenal <https://github.com/scality/Arsenal>`__ repository, in
`lib/algos/list <https://github.com/scality/Arsenal/tree/master/lib/algos/list>`__.
